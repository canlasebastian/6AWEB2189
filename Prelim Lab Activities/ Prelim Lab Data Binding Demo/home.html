  <h2>About Me</h2>

    Hi, I'm <strong>Sebastian Canlas</strong>, a passionate web developer who loves building
    clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. I enjoy turning ideas into
    functional web applications using modern technologies like HTML, CSS,
    JavaScript, and frameworks such as Angular and React.

    My goal is to create digital experiences that not only look great but also
    perform smoothly. Whether it's front-end design or back-end logic, I’m always
    eager to learn new tools and improve my craft.
